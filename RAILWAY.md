# Deploying to Railway

This project deploys as a **single Railway service** — the Express API server also serves the pre-built React frontend, so both share the same origin and no CORS configuration is needed.

---

## Prerequisites

- A [Railway](https://railway.app) account
- Your project pushed to a GitHub repository

---

## Step 1 — Create a new Railway project

1. Go to [railway.app/new](https://railway.app/new) and click **Deploy from GitHub repo**
2. Select your repository — Railway will detect the `Dockerfile` automatically

---

## Step 2 — Add a PostgreSQL database

1. In your Railway project, click **+ New** → **Database** → **PostgreSQL**
2. Railway will provision a Postgres instance and add `DATABASE_URL` to the service's shared variables automatically

---

## Step 3 — Set environment variables

In your service's **Variables** tab, add:

| Variable | Value | Notes |
|----------|-------|-------|
| `NODE_ENV` | `production` | Disables dev-only seeding and enables static file serving |
| `SESSION_SECRET` | `<random 64-char string>` | Used for JWT signing — generate with `openssl rand -hex 32` |
| `DATABASE_URL` | *(auto-injected by Railway PostgreSQL)* | No action needed if you added the DB add-on |
| `ADMIN_EMAIL` | Your administrator email | Used once to create the first `super_admin` account |
| `ADMIN_PASSWORD` | A strong password (12+ characters) | Used once to create the first `super_admin` account |

> **Tip:** Generate a strong secret with: `openssl rand -hex 32`

On the first production startup, if both `ADMIN_EMAIL` and `ADMIN_PASSWORD` are
present, the API creates that administrator when the email does not exist yet.
If the account already exists, startup does not change its password or role.
After confirming that you can log in, remove `ADMIN_PASSWORD` from the Railway
service variables and redeploy; it is only needed for first-account bootstrap.

---

## Step 4 — Run database migrations (first deploy only)

After the first successful deploy, open the service's **Shell** tab and run:

```bash
cd /app
# The migration tool needs the workspace source, so run it locally or via
# a one-off Railway run command:
```

Because the Docker image only ships the compiled bundle (not the source), run migrations **before** the first deploy from your local machine or Replit:

```bash
# On Replit / local, with DATABASE_URL set to your Railway Postgres URL:
DATABASE_URL="<your-railway-postgres-url>" pnpm --filter @workspace/db run push
```

You can find the Railway Postgres URL in the database service's **Variables** tab under `DATABASE_URL`.

---

## Step 5 — Deploy

Push a commit to your GitHub main branch — Railway will rebuild and redeploy automatically.

The health-check endpoint is at:
```
GET /api/healthz   →  { "status": "ok" }
```

## Environment variable reference

| Variable | Required | Default | Description |
|----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `PORT` | Yes | `8080` (Docker default) | Railway injects this automatically |
| `DATABASE_URL` | Yes | — | PostgreSQL connection string |
| `SESSION_SECRET` | Yes | — | JWT signing secret (min 32 chars) |
| `NODE_ENV` | Yes | — | Set to `production` |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | No | `info` | Pino log level (`debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`) |
| `ADMIN_EMAIL` | Only for first bootstrap | — | Email for the initial `super_admin` |
| `ADMIN_PASSWORD` | Only for first bootstrap | — | Initial admin password (12+ characters) |

---

## Local Docker test

To verify the image builds and runs correctly before pushing to Railway:

```bash
# Build
docker build -t midanic .

# Run (supply your own DATABASE_URL)
docker run -p 8080:8080 \
  -e DATABASE_URL="postgres://user:pass@host:5432/db" \
  -e SESSION_SECRET="$(openssl rand -hex 32)" \
  -e NODE_ENV=production \
  midanic
```

Open http://localhost:8080 — you should see the Midanic homepage.
